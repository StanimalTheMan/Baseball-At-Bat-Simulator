# Baseball At Bat Simulator

## Improvements That Can Be Made
This program currently is basic and employs some oop features using Java such as basic polymorphism and inheritance that can be enhanced further.  Only one at bat between a pitcher and batter is possible at
the moment.  Also, when it says a batter got a hit, it does not differentiate types of hits such as a homerun and a single.  Also, it does not let a batter hit non strikes.  It seems that a strike a pitcher throws based on his strike % is a pitch that lands in the virtual strike zone and does not include a nasty pitch that eventually
falls outside the box shaped strike zone.  

## Idea found on Chegg but no solution was provided and I decided to implement it rudimentarily to say the least
Your task is to write a program in java to simulate a batter facing a pitcher in a baseball game

Your program should include a Batter class with the following fields and methods: private String name private String position private double average /* Assumes the pitcher has thrown a strike, uses this batter’s average to determine whether he hits the pitch (method returns true) or swings and misses (method returns false). */ public boolean hit() public String getName() // returns the Batter’s name You will also need to write a Pitcher class with the following fields and methods: private String name private String position private double strikeAverage /* Uses this pitchers average to determine whether he throws a strike (method returns true) or a ball (method returns false). */ public boolean pitch() public String getName() // returns the Pitcher’s name You will then need to write a driver program that instantiates a Pitcher object and a Batter object and simulates an at-bat. The rules for this simulation are as follows: If a Pitcher’s strikeAverage is, for example, .80 then 80 percent of the time calling the Pitcher class’s pitch method should return true and 20 percent of the time it should return false. The Batter never swings at a ball and he always swings at a pitch in the strike zone. If the pitch is in the strike zone, the Batter’s hit method should be called. If the Batter’s average is .25 then 25 percent of the time, that method should return true (indicating a hit) and 75 percent of the time it should return false (indicating a swing and a miss). If the Batter’s name is John Doe and he gets a hit, your driver program should display the message “John Doe got a hit!” Your driver program should keep track of the number of balls and strikes. If the number of balls reaches four, the program should display the message “John Doe walked.” If the number of strikes reaches three, it should display the message “John Doe struck out.” After each pitch, your program should display the number of balls and strikes.
